                            Fondly nicknamed "the Durian" by Singaporeans due to its resemblance to the popular fruit here, Esplanade is home to a 1,600-seat Concert Hall,
                            a 2,000 seat Theatre and several other smaller performance venues. Esplanade has hosted various world-class performances and high-profile events
                            such as the return of the musical <span id="LM">Les Misérables</span>.

                            As Esplanade approaches 16, it remains as one of the busiest arts centres in the world with a total of about 37,000 shows and 26 million guests.
                            Esplande is a not-for-profit arts centre that aims to entertain, engage, educate and inspire its visitors through arts due to their beliefs in
                            making the arts accessible for everyone.
