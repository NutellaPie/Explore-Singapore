            The frenzy that ensued the Bukit Timah Railway after reports of it closing down has since died down, with the place being thrust out of the public eye. 
            Even though the railway track is no longer in use, it still exists as a sentimental reminder of Singapore's railway history and heritage.

            Bukit Timah Railway Station was a railway station owned by Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM), the main railway operator in Malaysia.
            It opened on the now defunct Tank Road mainline in 1903 and was rebuilt on the current Singapore-Johor Bahru KTM Inter-city mainline in 1932.
            This was until the Jurong Line shut down and it was a crossing loop station in the late 1940s until closure. The station was a freight interchange
            for the currently inoperative Jurong Line from 1965 to the early 1990s.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph viewparagraph">
            On 1st July 2011, the line closed following a historic land-swap agreement between the Singapore and Malaysia governments which saw rail service
            between Woodlands and Tanjong Pagar cease. Most of the tracks were removed, but there are still a few places with tracks left for the interested
            explorers to visit. Once a crossing loop station and signalling control house, the Bukit Timah Railway Station (now known as Bukit Timah Railway Corridor)
            is now part of Singapore's Nature Society and URA's Rail Corridor project.

            The Bukit Timah Railway Station is open 24/7, but it is highly advisable not to visit this attraction
