            A UFO looking water tank, the Portsdown Water Tank is located in the quiet neighbourhood of Portsdown Road and
            is an old water tank that wouldn’t be out of place in American films.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph viewparagraph">
            If the water tank is not your thing, don’t worry because located along Portsdown Road are many indie cafes and bars. 
            So, make sure you go with an empty stomach, especially since many of them and their dishes are very Instagram-worthy as well.
