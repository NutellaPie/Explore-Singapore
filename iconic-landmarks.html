            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p class="introduction col-left">
                As Singapore continues to grow economically,
                the government has more captial on hand to build more
                iconic landmarks in our island city. One example would be
                The Jewel at Changi Airport, a retail destination which features
                state-of-the-art facilities that makes it eco-friednly. The said architecture
                is schedule for opening in 2019.

                However, like the Leaning Tower of Pisa or Great Wall of China,
                Singapore also comes with it's set of unique landmarks which are not
                known to many. Examples include the Portsdown Water Tank or the Bukit Timah
                Railway Connector which withstood the test of time and has now given us
                an opportunity to take a trip down memory lane (and not forgetting those
                aesthetic Instagram posts!)
