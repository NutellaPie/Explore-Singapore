        <p class="paragraph">
            At 36 metres above ground, the Henderson Waves bridge is the highest pedestrian bridge in Singapore.
            Completed in 2008, its wave-like shape has sent a fresh, modern look to the lush green
            belt in the south of Singapore.

        <p class="paragraph viewparagraph">
            As the name suggests, the bridge mimics the undulating shape of a wave, curving and twisting along
            its entire 274-metre length. Its magnificent architecture is made with curved ‘ribs’—slats of Balau wood,
            a dense hardwood used in heavy construction and which is found only in Southeast Asia.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph viewparagraph">
            Its shape allows it to have hidden recesses and shell-like niches, where visitors can sit and observe
            their surroundings. Because there’s privacy and room to rest, the bridge is a popular spot on weekends with
            couples, families with children and joggers.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph viewparagraph">
            As dusk falls, stunning effects by light-emitting diode (LED) lighting populate the bridge from 7pm to 2am every night.
            A must-see if you do visit this bridge!

            The best way to explore the bridge which is part of the
            <a class="links" href="http://www.visitsingapore.com/see-do-singapore/nature-wildlife/parks-gardens/the-southern-ridges/">Southern Ridges Walk</a>,
            is to complete a five-kilometre hiking trail that takes you through three major parks: Kent Ridge Park, Telok Blangah Hill Park and
            <a class="links" href="http://www.visitsingapore.com/see-do-singapore/nature-wildlife/parks-gardens/mount-faber/">Mount Faber Park.</a>
            It is the latter two that Henderson Waves connects.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph viewparagraph">
            Aside from being able to observe a rich variety of tropical flora and fauna, a walk on the Ridges
            also affords you some stunning views of the island. The walk of 5 kilometres is also a form of exercise!
